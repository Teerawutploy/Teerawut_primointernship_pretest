# Teerawut_primointernship_pretest

In this repo you have to go master branch to see the file about pretest. In master branch will have src folder and test folder, src for collect code about merge function and test will keep test case code, I use Jest for testing. When you clone my project you can use (npm install) for download all dependencies. If you want to run my code you can (npm run build) and the code.js will create in result folder and use (npm start) for starting. Use (npm run test) for runing the test. Thank you
